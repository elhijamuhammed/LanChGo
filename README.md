           LanChGo v1.3.2
====================================

Thank you for installing LanChGo!

LanChGo is a simple, fast, and private chat app that works over your local network.  
It lets you talk freely with others on the same Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection  
without the need for internet access.

LanChGo uses the UDP broadcast protocol for instant local communication.  
There is no handshake — by design — ensuring your messages are sent immediately  
to anyone on the same network running LanChGo.

------------------------------------
 How to Use
------------------------------------
1. Start the LanChGo app.
2. Choose your network interface (Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
3. Type your message in the input box.
4. Press Enter or click "Send" to broadcast your message.
5. To start a secure private channel:
   - Switch to "Secure" mode.
   - Create or join a channel using the provided PIN.

All devices on the same subnet running LanChGo will instantly receive messages.
