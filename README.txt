====================================
           LanChGo v1.4.3
====================================

Thank you for installing LanChGo!

LanChGo is a simple, fast, and privacy-focused communication app that works
entirely over your local network (LAN). It allows devices on the same Wi-Fi
or Ethernet network to communicate and transfer files without any internet
connection.

LanChGo uses UDP broadcast for instant local discovery and messaging,
combined with TCP for reliable file transfers. No external servers,
no accounts, and no cloud involvement.

------------------------------------
 How to Use
------------------------------------
1. Start the LanChGo app.
2. Select your active network interface (Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
3. Type a message and press Enter or click "Send" to broadcast it.
4. All devices on the same subnet running LanChGo will receive it instantly.

Secure Private Channel:
- Switch to "Secure" mode.
- Create or join a channel using the generated PIN.
- Messages are end-to-end encrypted within the channel.

File Transfer:
- Click the **Files** button.
- Select one or multiple files to send.
- The receiving device can download them directly.
- Multiple files are bundled automatically into a ZIP for convenience.
